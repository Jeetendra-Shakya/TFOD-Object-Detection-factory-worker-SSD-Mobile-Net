# TFOD-Object-Detection-factory-worker-SSD-Mobile-Net

This is project to identify whether person wearing Person/Helmet/No Helmet/Visible Jacket/Visible No Jacket created with around 200 images manually labelled and train to get best output.

I am using SDD Mobile Net to train this model with 200000 steps.

I manage to achieve 99% accuracy.

Here is location of TFOD files:

If you are looking for inferance graph (after training) and labelmap file here is location:

If you have camera in your system it will be able to detect many person with Helmet/No Helmet/Visible Jacket/Visible No Jacket

Outcome:
1 - Compare to Faster RCNN it took around triple to train same dataset.

2 - Image detection accurary is same 99% however video detection drop as per expected to around 80% but better than Faster RCNN
